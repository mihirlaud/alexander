## What is a TTRPG?

A tabletop RPG, or **TTRPG** for short, is a type of game where participants roleplay as characters in a story or campaign. One player, called the "game master" or "dungeon master" depending on the RPG, creates said campaign, while other players engage by acting out what their character would do through speaking, rolling dice, and other game mechanics. Examples of TTRPGs include Dungeons & Dragons, Call of Cthulhu, and The Sprawl.

## What is Alexander?

In the course of playing a TTRPG, game masters will frequently design "encounters" for their players, scenarios that often involve players taking turns fighting enemies on some sort of map. Encounters can be very long and messy, with game masters having to keep track of their players' positions, the enemies' positions, whose turn is it, and other unforeseen variables. This project aims to streamline the process of running encounters so that game masters can focus on creating awesome campaigns for their players.

Alexander is a tool—rather, a suite of tools—made for game masters to more smoothly and efficiently run encounters in tabletop RPGs. When finished, Alexander will keep track of initiative and PC/NPC positions for the game master, will allow GMs to set timers for events or skill challenges, and will be able to aid in decision making for enemy strategy.
